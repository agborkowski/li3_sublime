A [Sublime 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) Snippet Package for the [Lithium](http://lithify.me) PHP Framework

This is a package of useful code snippets to help during Rapid Application Development. The snippets are organized into three folders; form, html and general snippets.

1. Form Snippets provide you quick code to generate HTML forms and widgets (see [Li3 Form Helper Doc](http://lithify.me/docs/lithium/template/helper/Form))

2. For those needing quick HTML template assistance there are code snippets for that too (see [Li3 HTML Helper](http://lithify.me/docs/lithium/template/helper/Html))

3. General snippets are just that...general.
